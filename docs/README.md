# Ganahl Lumber AI Capabilities Demonstration

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how an advanced agentic AI can proactively manage Ganahl Lumber's operations, including inventory management, customer orders, supply chain logistics, and contractor project planning. The demonstration showcases the AI's ability to anticipate needs and execute complex tasks independently.

## Features Implemented
1. **Autonomous Inventory Management** - AI-powered inventory analysis and restocking that predicts shortages, prioritizes orders, and ensures optimal stock levels.
2. **Real-Time Adaptability** - Dynamic adjustment to sudden changes in demand, finding alternative suppliers and reprioritizing orders.
3. **Interactive Command Processing** - Natural language command understanding and execution with detailed reasoning.
4. **Autonomous Customer Service** - Handling customer inquiries, checking inventory, confirming availability, and providing delivery information.
5. **Business Impact Quantification** - Efficiency gains and cost savings directly impacting Ganahl Lumber's bottom line.

## Files Included
- `index.html` - Main webpage with all demonstration features
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality for interactive elements
- `inventory_data.json` - Mock inventory data structure
- `inventory_restocking_logic.py` - Logic for autonomous inventory management
- `inventory_adaptability.py` - Implementation of real-time adaptability feature
- `interactive_command.py` - Command processing functionality
- `customer_service_scenario.py` - Customer service scenario implementation
- `business_impact_analysis.md` - Analysis of efficiency gains and cost savings
- `operational_context.md` - Research on Ganahl Lumber's operational context
- `internal_needs_summary.md` - Summary of Ganahl Lumber's likely needs

## How to Use the Demonstration

### Running the Demonstration
1. Extract all files from the zip archive to a directory
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The demonstration will load automatically

### Interacting with Features
1. **Inventory Management**
   - View the current inventory levels and purchase orders
   - Click "Refresh Data" to simulate inventory updates

2. **Adaptability Feature**
   - Click "Trigger Demand Spike" to see how the AI adapts to a sudden demand for Cedar Decking
   - Watch the AI Decision Log update in real-time with the reasoning process

3. **Command Processing**
   - Enter "Plan a delivery schedule for 500 board feet of cedar next week" in the command input field
   - Click "Submit" to see the AI's response and reasoning process

4. **Customer Service**
   - Click on the customer inquiry example to see how the AI would respond
   - Review the detailed delivery schedule and reasoning process

5. **Business Impact**
   - Scroll to the bottom to see quantified efficiency gains and cost savings

## Technical Implementation
- The demonstration uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
- Mock data structures simulate real-world inventory and order processing
- JavaScript functions handle user interactions and display AI responses
- The design is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

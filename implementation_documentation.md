### Components

#### 1. Autonomous Inventory Management
- **File**: `inventory_restocking_logic.py`
- **Description**: AI-powered inventory analysis and restocking that predicts shortages, prioritizes orders, and ensures optimal stock levels.
- **Features**:
  - Analyzes current inventory levels against sales trends
  - Considers upcoming orders and delivery timelines
  - Generates purchase orders with priority levels
  - Provides detailed reasoning for each decision
- **Output**: Purchase orders in JSON format and decision log in text format

#### 2. Real-Time Adaptability
- **File**: `inventory_adaptability.py`
- **Description**: Dynamic adjustment to sudden changes in demand, finding alternative suppliers and reprioritizing orders.
- **Features**:
  - Detects demand spikes and adjusts ordering strategy
  - Evaluates alternative suppliers based on lead time
  - Recalculates priorities based on changing conditions
  - Provides before/after comparison of decisions
- **Output**: Updated purchase orders and decision logs reflecting adaptations

#### 3. Interactive Command Processing
- **File**: `interactive_command.py`
- **Description**: Natural language command understanding and execution with detailed reasoning.
- **Features**:
  - Parses natural language commands
  - Extracts key information (product, quantity, timeline)
  - Generates delivery schedules based on logistics constraints
  - Provides reasoning for each step of the process
- **Output**: Structured response with delivery schedule details

#### 4. Autonomous Customer Service
- **File**: `customer_service_scenario.py`
- **Description**: Handling customer inquiries, checking inventory, confirming availability, and providing delivery information.
- **Features**:
  - Analyzes customer inquiries for product and quantity needs
  - Checks current inventory and alternative sourcing options
  - Calculates delivery logistics and timelines
  - Provides comprehensive response with delivery details
- **Output**: Customer service response with delivery schedule and stock information

#### 5. Web Interface
- **Files**: `index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`
- **Description**: Interactive web interface demonstrating all AI capabilities.
- **Features**:
  - Inventory dashboard with real-time data
  - Demand spike simulation controls
  - Command input interface
  - Customer service scenario demonstration
  - Business impact visualization

### Implementation Notes

1. **Data Structure**
   - Inventory data is stored in JSON format with categories for lumber, sheet goods, and hardware
   - Each product includes stock levels, reorder points, and supplier information
   - Sales trends include weekly and monthly data with seasonal factors

2. **Decision Logic**
   - Inventory decisions use a priority-based system (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Decisions consider current stock, projected stock after orders, and reorder points
   - Adaptability logic evaluates alternative suppliers based on lead time and availability

3. **Output Files**
   - All output files are stored in the `src/data/` directory
   - JSON files maintain structured data for potential integration with other systems
   - Text logs provide human-readable explanations of AI reasoning

## Running the Demonstration

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Web browser for the interface demonstration

### Steps to Run

1. **Inventory Management Demonstration**
   ```
   cd src/logic
   python3 inventory_restocking_logic.py
   ```

2. **Adaptability Demonstration**
   ```
   cd src/logic
   python3 inventory_adaptability.py
   ```

3. **Command Processing Demonstration**
   ```
   cd src/logic
   python3 interactive_command.py
   ```

4. **Customer Service Demonstration**
   ```
   cd src/logic
   python3 customer_service_scenario.py
   ```

5. **Web Interface**
   - Open `src/web/index.html` in a web browser

## Testing and Validation

All components have been tested to ensure proper functionality:

1. **Inventory Management**: Verified correct purchase order generation based on inventory levels and upcoming orders
2. **Adaptability**: Confirmed appropriate response to demand spikes with supplier switching when beneficial
3. **Command Processing**: Validated natural language understanding and appropriate delivery scheduling
4. **Customer Service**: Tested inquiry handling with various stock scenarios and delivery requirements
5. **Web Interface**: Verified all interactive elements function as expected

## Future Enhancements
